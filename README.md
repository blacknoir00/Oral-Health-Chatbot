# Oral-Health-Chatbot

I have created Oral Health Chatbot using chainlit and Llama 2 model and data used on this model is Oral Pathology and oral Medicine by R. A. CAWSON and E. W. ODELL

Chainlit is an open-source Python package that makes it incredibly fast to build Chat GPT like applications with your own business logic and data.

Llama 2 pretrained models are trained on 2 trillion tokens, and have double the context length than Llama 1. Its fine-tuned models have been trained on over 1 million human annotations.
Llama 2 is available for free for research and commercial use.
