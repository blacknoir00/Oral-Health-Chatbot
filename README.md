# Oral-Health-Chatbot

I have created Oral Health Chatbot using chainlit and Llama 2 model and data used on this model is Oral Pathology and oral Medicine by R. A. CAWSON and E. W. ODELL

Chainlit is an open-source Python package that makes it incredibly fast to build Chat GPT like applications with your own business logic and data.

Llama 2 pretrained models are trained on 2 trillion tokens, and have double the context length than Llama 1. Its fine-tuned models have been trained on over 1 million human annotations.
Llama 2 is available for free for research and commercial use.

you can find Llama models @ https://huggingface.co/models?other=llama-2

# How To Run:

1. At first run llm.py, "python llm.py" to create vectorstore\db_faiss
2. now run chainlit run "model.py -w"
